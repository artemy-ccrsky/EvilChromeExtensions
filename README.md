## 🛠️ How to use
#### ⚠️ HTTPS Limitation

> Chrome does **not** support self-signed HTTPS certificates for extensions or their backends.  
> 
> - Use **strict HTTP** (only for labs / controlled environments).  
> - Or use **strict HTTPS** with a valid certificate from a trusted CA.  
> 
> Anything in-between (self-signed HTTPS) will fail.

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/artemy-ccrsky/EvilChromeExtensions.git
   cd EvilChromeExtensions
   ```
2. Change Attacker Host in source code of extension and run Python Flask (for example) server on backend to catch POST Requests
3. Run Chrome extensions with provided CLI:

```powershell
"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --disable-features=DisableLoadExtensionCommandLineSwitch --load-extension="C:\Users\user\Desktop\offensive-extension"
```

To Run Chrome in Debug mode with stderr:

```powershell
"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --disable-features=DisableLoadExtensionCommandLineSwitch --load-extension="C:\Users\user\Desktop\offensive-extension" --enable-logging=stderr --v=1
```

4. **Simple way**. Using GUI and Developer Mode in Chrome -> chrome://extensions -> Enable "Developer Mode" -> Upload unpacked extension.
5. **Stealth way**. Use [SharpSilentChrome](https://github.com/ChoiSG/SharpSilentChrome) to silently install Chrome Extension


## 🔐 Detection & Hardening Tips

- Monitor changes in configuration files (`Preferences`, `Secure Preferences`) made by processes other than `chrome.exe`  
- Monitor for Chrome processes launched with the `--load-extension` parameter  
- Harden Enterprise Browser policies (whitelist/blocklist, disable installation of unpacked extensions)
